# Exercises from "iOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide"

Inspired by the repository [iOS-Programming-The-Big-Nerd-Ranch-Guide](https://github.com/rahims/iOS-Programming-The-Big-Nerd-Ranch-Guide) I decided to upload the exercises from some of the chapters of [iOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide](https://www.bignerdranch.com/book/ios_programming_the_big_nerd_ranch_guide) (4th Edition). 

## Missing Chapters
Chapter 3 is missing because at the time I didn't want to go too deeply on the subject of Memory Management and ARC.  
Chapter 4 is missing but Chapter 5 holds the relevant code needed in the previous chapter.  
For now I have skipped chapter 10 but I intend to do it in the future, as well as the subsequent chapters.
